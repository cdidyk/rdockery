# FF print html page to PDF works well enough.
#
# 1. Go through classes and files dirs of rdoc
# 2. For each file, take its body? contents and append it to a master file
# 3. The master file should have a proper XHTML head (including stylesheet)/doctype/ (take
#    from first file?)
# 4. The master file can be viewed as html in Firefox and printed to a saved PDF
#
# Should organization be files then classes or classes under their respective files? I think
# the latter.
#
# Usage is:
#
# rdockery <path_to_rdoc_file_root>
# (usually RAILS.root/doc)
